# Sync safety fix and StreamHG mapping recovery

The previous version could remove StreamHG references after two file/info 404 responses and write other changes even when Abyss failed. This update blocks all mapping writes whenever any provider is unverified.

1. Temporarily disable the old CLIXARENA mapping sync workflow in GitHub Actions.
2. Copy scripts/clixarena_mapping_sync.py, scripts/clixarena_mapping_restore.py and .github/workflows/clixarena-mapping-sync.yml into the existing video-setup repo, then commit/push to the default branch. Preserve all other scripts, host-selection changes, secrets and mappings.json.
3. Open GitHub repository commit history and find the sync commit titled 'Sync confirmed deleted video host mappings' that removed the 17 references. Open it and copy its full 40-character commit SHA.
4. Enable the updated workflow. Use Run workflow, choose operation=restore_streamhg and paste that SHA into restore_sync_commit. This restores only StreamHG references removed by that commit, without replacing newer uploads, existing StreamHG IDs, other provider references or updated subtitles. It performs no uploads/deletions on video hosts. Repeated recovery is idempotent.
5. Run operation=sync only after recovery. Any incomplete provider check now leaves the entire mapping file unchanged. Safe warnings show the failing stage/status without private data. Share only those warnings if further API adaptation is needed.

New behavior:
- StreamHG requires account/info account identity, two matching file/info 404s, and matching entries in two reads of the account file/deleted list for the last 168 hours. Older missing files without deletion evidence remain mapped.
- At least five missing references representing at least 25% of any host's mapped IDs trigger a bulk-deletion guard. No writes occur.
- Any unavailable/unverified provider blocks the whole sync write; exit 1 means incomplete sync, not success.
- Abyss /v1/about validation now matches the supplied official quota sample: storageQuota, uploadQuota and maxUploadSize. Authentication uses ?key=API_KEY as explicitly documented. It does not require account id/email. GET /v1/files/:id must return the matching file ID on HTTP 200. A missing result without an explicit matching file ID is preserved rather than treated as deletion. The supplied Update info file sample describes a write endpoint; this sync never calls PUT/PATCH/DELETE or changes files at Abyss. Live GET-file/missing-file response formats remain unverified.
- GitHub file-SHA conflicts reload current mappings before a retry. Encryption/password format is unchanged.

Existing secrets: MAPPING_PASSWORD, STREAMTAPE_LOGIN, STREAMTAPE_KEY, STREAMHG_API_KEY, ABYSS_API_KEY. Built-in GitHub token has Contents write permission. No new secret is required.

17 mocked tests passed, including all-missing safety, account history cross-check, no writes on any host failure, recovery after concurrent/new uploads and repeated recovery. No live account sync, restoration or workflow run was triggered here.

Update the files in the existing video-setup repository and push. No Hugging Face or control UI changes and no new secrets are required. Keep the existing ABYSS_API_KEY. This includes the prior safety/recovery workflow. For the quota correction itself the only changed runtime file relative to the previous safety ZIP is scripts/clixarena_mapping_sync.py.


## Abyss HTTP 403 and Bearer authentication update

The earlier run only proved HTTP 403, not whether it was credentials, account policy or provider/network protection. This version reports the exact fixed stage (Abyss login, quota lookup, file lookup) plus numeric status. It does not claim to bypass a provider block.

To use documented automatic login/Bearer auth, add these GitHub Actions secrets on video-setup:
- ABYSS_EMAIL: Abyss account login email.
- ABYSS_PASSWORD: Abyss account login password, NOT MAPPING_PASSWORD.
Keep ABYSS_API_KEY because upload still uses that key. Both login fields must be configured together.

Each sync run logs in once through POST https://api.abyss.to/auth/login with the documented email/password JSON, masks the returned token, and sends it in Authorization: Bearer for quota/file checks. No account/file modifications are performed. If login fails there is no mapping write.

Alternative: ABYSS_AUTH_TOKEN can be a current login Bearer token; it can expire and is not required when email/password are supplied. Priority is automatic login, then explicit Bearer token, then existing API-key query mode. An API key is never guessed to be a Bearer token. There is no repeated login/fallback on a 403.

Copy the updated workflow and scripts to the existing repository, commit/push, then manually run operation=sync if desired. No workflow was triggered here. If the provider also rejects the authenticated request, mappings remain unchanged and the new stage warning identifies the rejection. 21 mocked tests passed; real account access remains untested.

## Abyss HTTP 404 deletion confirmation fix

Previously, abyss_file_missing required body.get('id') == fid in order to recognize a 404 response as a deletion. Because Abyss's standard REST API returns {"message": "File not found"} or {"message": "Not Found"} without echoing back the file ID, missing files triggered an unconfirmed deletion warning and halted the mapping sync workflow with exit code 1.

This update adapts the check:
- Accepts standard missing messages ('file not found', 'video not found', 'file does not exist', 'video does not exist', 'not found').
- Permits body.get('id') to be omitted (None) or matching the requested file ID.
- Mismatched IDs or unexpected error formats continue to be treated as unverified.
- Twice-confirmed missing Abyss files are now cleanly pruned from mappings.json while preserving active files and other hosts.

## Telegram 4th Upload Host and Security Hardening

Release update: Added `telegram` as the 4th upload destination alongside Streamtape, StreamHG, and Abyss.

### Features
- Direct upload to Telegram Private Storage Channels.
- Returns Telegram Message ID, mapped into `mappings.json` as `telegram_id` and `providers.telegram.file_id`.
- Synchronous upload verification; files in private storage channels do not expire or get deleted due to inactivity.

### Security Hardening in GitHub Actions
1. **Automatic Secret Masking:** `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` are masked on startup with `::add-mask::`.
2. **Zero-leakage Upload Configuration:** All curl requests pass tokens and parameters via stdin config (`--config -`), preventing credential inspection via process tables (`ps`).
3. **2GB Hard Guard:** Enforces Telegram's 2,000MB file limit before initiating upload, with a safe, descriptive error message.
4. **Least Privilege Permissions:** Workflow permissions in `.github/workflows/clixarena-video.yml` restrict `pull-requests: none`, `issues: none`, `packages: none`, and `id-token: none`.
5. **AES-GCM Encryption:** Mapping storage remains encrypted with `MAPPING_PASSWORD`.

### Required Repository Secrets
Add these to GitHub Actions secrets if selecting Telegram as an upload host:
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: HTTP Bot token from @BotFather.
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Private storage channel ID (e.g. `-1002345678901`).
- `TELEGRAM_API_ID` & `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` (optional): From my.telegram.org for large file MTProto uploads (>50MB).
